Because the reviewed first-party openings inventory was stale and all verified public roles were located in Nigeria or Rwanda rather than India, no trustworthy current public jobs contract was verified for Chipper Cash India, so this company-local scraper stays fail-closed and returns no jobs until a stable current openings flow is verified.",
