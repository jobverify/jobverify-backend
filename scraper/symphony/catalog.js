    'Verified on Friday, July 17, 2026 that https://symphonylimited.com/careers/current-openings/ is the live first-party Symphony Limited careers page, that it asks candidates to write to careers@symphonylimited.com with their resume, and that it explicitly says "There are no current openings. Please check this space later." There is no trustworthy public jobs list for the exact-name Symphony row on the verified page, so this provider fails closed and returns no jobs until Symphony publishes a stable public openings surface.',
