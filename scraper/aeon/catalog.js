    "Verified on July 14, 2026 that https://www.aeoncredit.co.in/ is the live AEON Credit India homepage, https://www.aeoncredit.co.in/careers is the first-party careers hub, and https://www.aeoncredit.co.in/careers/join-us is the first-party join-us page that links View Job Vacancy to https://careers-aeoncredit.peoplestrong.com/job/joblist. There is no trustworthy public jobs surface: the linked PeopleStrong joblist and its public jobs API returned 403 Forbidden during live checks, so AEON's India careers surface is currently only a first-party informational handoff plus email contact rather than a usable public job board.",
