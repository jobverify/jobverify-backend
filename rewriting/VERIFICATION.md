# LFM and empty-description verification

The checks below were recorded locally on 11 October 2026 with the previous checkpoint. They predate the 21 October 2026 switch to LFM2.5-1.2B-Instruct QAD Q4_0 and do not verify the new checkpoint. The model switch was not tested locally; GitHub pipeline validation is pending. No GitHub workflow was dispatched, repository variable changed, or production MongoDB data written for this switch.

## Result

The configured description rewriting model is **LiquidAI/LFM2.5-1.2B-Instruct-GGUF**, using the pinned LFM2.5-1.2B-Instruct-QAD-Q4_0.gguf artifact (695,755,488 bytes). The production worker uses the LFM Jinja chat template and up to four CPU threads, with a 128 MiB prompt-cache cap. The workflow has fresh model and decision cache keys; request identities prevent reuse of another model's decisions.

The generic publishing filter rejects absent, null, blank, spacing-only and empty-HTML employer descriptions before enrichment, persistence and rewrite queueing. Explicitly empty source content cannot fall back to generated display text. Historical records with empty sources are excluded from public queries and counts. Filter diagnostics and resume checkpoints include filteredEmptyDescription. An empty later scrape cannot replace the last valid stored description; raw snapshots remain available for diagnostics.

## Historical checks for the previous checkpoint

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Description/admin/queue/persistence/visibility regression suite | 132/132 passed |
| Native MongoDB empty-description visibility | Passed, including 10,000 empty tags, long script bodies, and a long whitespace/markup prefix preceding real text |
| Frontend unit suite | 444/444 passed |
| Admin description browser checks | 3/3 passed; LFM label, persisted auto-run switch, manual dispatch, errors and mobile state verified with mocked APIs |
| Native pinned LFM production worker/client | Passed; 1410 ms for one sample, 392.1 MiB worker memory, 63.4% peak host memory |
| Existing host memory cutoff tests | 3/3 passed; >90% stops its child, high memory prevents startup, high CPU alone does not stop it |
| Backend syntax check | Passed; 15,443 JavaScript files checked |
| Patch whitespace check | Passed |
| Broad backend npm test | 18,470 passed, 214 failed, 12 skipped |

The native worker smoke test uses predownloaded, checksum-verified assets and an in-memory update callback. It checks literal employer wording and required/preferred sections, stops above 90% host RAM, and always shuts down the worker. One sample is not a 30,000-job benchmark or a GitHub throughput guarantee. The earlier full LFM dry run is documented in [BENCHMARK.md](BENCHMARK.md).

The broad suite is not green. Scraper/catalog tests fail, and classification files were concurrently edited or removed during the run. These results therefore do not describe an immutable release snapshot, and not every failure is attributed to a pre-existing issue. After those edits, the latest focused description regression run passed all 132 tests. Raw local logs are in .cache/lfm-description-regressions.log, .cache/lfm-full-tests.log, .cache/lfm-native-smoke.log and .cache/lfm-lint.log.

See [CONTROLS.md](CONTROLS.md) for admin configuration and the live GitHub acceptance checks.

## Broad-suite failure names

The names below are copied from the complete test log, including reported parent failures. Repeated copies in the reporter's final recap and entries for the removed classification implementation are omitted. The totals above describe the original broad-suite snapshot. GLiClass cleanup was checked separately with 134 passing classification/persistence regressions.
